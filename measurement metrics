Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correctly classified instances by each algorithm. It compares the predicted output with the actual output and determines the overall accuracy.

Precision: Focuses on the quality of the positive predictions made by the algorithms. It calculates the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives.

Recall: Emphasizes the ability of the algorithms to identify positive instances correctly. It calculates the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.

F1 Score: Combines precision and recall into a single metric, providing a balanced evaluation. It calculates the harmonic mean of precision and recall, giving equal importance to both metrics.

Training Time: Measures the time taken by each algorithm to train on the given dataset. It assesses the efficiency of the algorithms in terms of training speed.

Model Size: Evaluates the size of the model generated by each algorithm. It examines the complexity and compactness of the resulting models.

Interpretability: Considers the ease of understanding and interpreting the generated models by humans. It assesses the simplicity and comprehensibility of the learned concepts.
